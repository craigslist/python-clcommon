This is the craigslist common python package. It contains modules used
by other packages or to be used independently. For full documentation,
run pydoc on the command line with package and module names::

    pydoc clcommon

An HTML version of the documentation can also be built. Once complete,
point a browser to: doc/_build/html/index.html::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

To install the package (use --prefix option for a specific location)::

    python setup.py install

To run the test suite::

    python setup.py nosetests

If python-coverage is installed, text and HTML code coverage reports can
be generated for the test suite and command line programs by running::

    ./coverage.sh

There are a number of code style checks already in place using the tools
below. While they are good settings for now, don't hesitate to bring up
any violations encountered for discussion if it should be allowed. To
run the checks::

    pylint -iy --rcfile .pylintrc clcommon test setup.py
    pep8 --ignore=E128 -r .
    pyflakes . | grep -v "undefined name '_'"

To build a source tarball for distribution (see 'dist' directory after)::

    python setup.py sdist
